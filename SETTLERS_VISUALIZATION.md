# Settlers-Style Canvas Visualization Implementation

This document explains the implementation of a canvas-based visualization system for the incremental game, inspired by "The Settlers 2" game. The visualization includes:

1. Visual representation of settlers moving around the map
2. Buildings that appear when constructed
3. Visual representation of resource gathering
4. Terrain features and map exploration

## Implementation Overview

The visualization system has been added using the following components:

1. A new `renderer.js` file containing the `Renderer` class that handles all canvas operations
2. Updated `index.html` to use a canvas element instead of div-based displays
3. Modified `game.js` to integrate with the renderer and provide keyboard controls
4. Updated game loop to sync the game state with the visualization

## Key Features

### Terrain System

- Tile-based map with different terrain types (grass, water, forest, mountain, clay)
- Simple procedural generation using a noise function
- Each terrain type has different properties and resource availability

### Entity Representation

- Settlers are visualized with different sprites based on their profession
- Buildings appear on the map as they reach 25% completion
- Resources are shown as collectible items that settlers can gather

### Animation and Movement

- Settlers move around the map based on their assigned tasks
- Pathfinding is handled with a simple direct-to-target approach
- Smooth animation is implemented using `requestAnimationFrame`

### Camera Controls

- Arrow keys move the camera around the map
- Plus/minus keys control zoom level
- The visible portion of the map updates based on camera position

## Usage

The visualization is fully integrated with the existing game logic. As settlers gather resources, build structures, and research technologies, these actions are reflected in the canvas display.

### Controls

- Arrow keys: Move camera
- +/- keys: Zoom in/out
- Time controls still work for controlling game speed

## Next Steps for Development

1. **Create Actual Sprites**:
   - Design 32x32 pixel sprites for all entities
   - Place them in the appropriate directories under `/assets/sprites/`
   - The renderer is already set up to use these sprites once they're available

2. **Add More Terrain Types**:
   - Expand the terrain generator to include more variety
   - Consider implementing biomes or regions

3. **Improve Pathfinding**:
   - Implement A* or another pathfinding algorithm for more realistic movement
   - Add obstacle avoidance for settlers

4. **Add Visual Effects**:
   - Weather effects (rain, snow)
   - Day/night cycle
   - Seasonal visual changes

5. **Add Interaction**:
   - Click to select settlers
   - Assign tasks through the UI
   - Build structures by clicking on the map

6. **Enhance Building Visualization**:
   - Show construction progress visually
   - Add animation for buildings under construction
   - Show different stages of building completion

7. **Sound Effects**:
   - Add ambient sounds based on terrain and weather
   - Action sounds for gathering, building, etc.

## Technical Implementation Details

### The Renderer Class

The main renderer class handles:

1. Managing the canvas context
2. Loading and displaying sprites
3. Managing entities (settlers, buildings, resources)
4. Rendering the game state
5. Handling camera controls and zoom

### Game Integration

The renderer integrates with the existing game logic through:

1. The `syncWithGameState()` method, which updates the visual state based on game data
2. Direct access to game components (settlement, environment)
3. A separate render loop that runs alongside the game logic loop

### Placeholder System

Until proper sprites are created, the renderer uses a color-based placeholder system:
- Terrain is shown as colored rectangles
- Settlers are shown as colored circles
- Buildings are shown as larger colored rectangles
- Resources are shown as small colored circles

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a solid foundation for a visual, interactive version of the incremental game with a "Settlers" aesthetic. The system is designed to be expandable and can be enhanced with better graphics, more complex behaviors, and additional features.
