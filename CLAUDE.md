This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This appears to be a new project called "incremental" that's in the very early stages of development. The repository currently has minimal structure with only configuration files (.env, .idea directory).

## Development Environment

Since this is a new project, specific build, test, and lint commands have not been established yet. As the project develops, please update this section with the appropriate commands for:

- Building the project
- Running tests
- Linting code
- Other common development workflows

## Project Structure

The basic project structure includes:
- `src/`: Source code directory (newly created)

As the codebase grows, update this file with information about the architecture, key components, and design patterns used.
